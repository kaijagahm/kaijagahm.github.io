## Bio

I am a biologist and data scientist. Currently, I'm studying the social behavior and movement ecology of griffon vultures in the [Pinter-Wollman Lab](https://pinterwollmanlab.eeb.ucla.edu/). Previously, I was a data manager at the Cary Institute and a research assistant with the [Yale Grammatical Diversity Project](https://ygdp.yale.edu/). I've written about my work with each of these organizations: [Cary](https://kaijagahm.netlify.app/projects/2021-07-13-retroactivelyreproducible/) \| [YGDP](https://kaijagahm.netlify.app/projects/2021-02-05-ygdp-dashboard/).

I did my B.S. in EEB at Yale, where I studied physiological tradeoffs in wood frog tadpoles ([talk](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1S57rDgoKSm0I4ssGYlKlMgnDmXNs58aR/view?usp=sharing) | <a href="files/Gahm_etal_2020.pdf" download>paper</a>).

I advocate for open and reproducible data science and help others to apply these ideas to their own work. I run "Hacky Hours" at UCLA, and I'm on the Board of Directors for [SORTEE](https://sortee.org/). I teach workshops with [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/index.html), and I'm currently developing a Carpentries workshop of my own!
